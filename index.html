                details: `
                    <p>The Iraq War was a protracted armed conflict in Iraq from 2003 to 2011 that began with the invasion of Iraq by a United States-led coalition that overthrew the government of Saddam Hussein. The conflict continued for much of the next decade as an insurgency emerged to oppose the coalition forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government.</p>
                    <p>The primary rationalization for the invasion was the assertion that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and that the Iraqi government posed a threat to the United States and its allies. No substantial evidence of WMD was found. The war resulted in the removal of Saddam Hussein's government and the execution of Saddam Hussein, but also triggered a sectarian civil war and the rise of ISIS.</p>
